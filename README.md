# adv-python-project

Earlier in my PhD I worked on strain field reconstruction, [with the code written in matlab and C (mexing)](https://github.com/carji475/probabilistic-modelling-and-reconstruction-of-strain). In this project my aim is to rewrite that in python, using equivalent routines for matrix algebra, calling of C-functions, optimisation and visualisation. Also, my intention is to make use of autodifferention from a suitable module (jax or pytorch) to avoid the need of explicit gradient computation.
